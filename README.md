### Scroll Bar:
For large chunks on information i have provided a scroll system for the user to read through the text at ease, without compromising other sections on the page.

External Links or Anchors:
The portfolio section i implimented the use of externak links to corresponding sites, here i have used icons that will takes the user to external sites that are relative to my profssional profile. 

Form section:
I have used a Form section for users to write to me, or email me ditectly. the boxes in the form section are animated and extend out when the user clicks or type within the boxes.

Nav bar:
A menu sits in the nav bar, its located on the side of the screen for small screens, and on the top of the page for lrg screens. The user can access the information they require immmedaitly. 
The menu has buttons that bring up the choosen section they require to view.


# Design and Layout

The design has been developed for Mobile First approach. 

The main focus on the design and layout was to be clear and simple, as information sometimes on a cv can be clustered, and overwelming for the reader,
sometimes the readerr can be put off with the CV because of the amount of information been displayed with the space, the aim was to provide information reletive to my CV. 
From top to bottom, left to right, the information on the site is simliar to how a tradition CV is layout.

I had designed the layout in a way that doesnt overload the reader/user with too much information as sometimes a tradtional cv can.
in fact the results are that the page provides my professional info to the user with ease to read, the user is made to feel at ease/comfortable by the use of colors, layout, spacing, white space, text style and images. 

The information on the page is layout systematically, so the user is not bombared with inforamtion that the user can skip over..
The design encourges the user to take time to absorb the info comfortably, the colours are kept muted and not so bright is a contrast to the white background which reflects the type/text in a clear fashion. 

A menu is provided on the side of the screen for small screens, and on the top of the page for lrg screens so the user can access the information they require immmedaitly. 
The menu has buttons that bring up the choosen section they require to view.

The project is hosted on [GitHub Pages] (https://8000-f3c5a7a2-27fb-4a25-ae3c-88d8cc7a0a56.ws-eu01.gitpod.io/)

The process involved:
- Host a git repository on GitHub. Explained [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/create-a-repo).
- The root folder contains README.md and index.html files
- On GitHub repository settings page move to GitHub Pages section
- Change source to master branch. (Or any desired branch)
- Provided link will be your projects home (index) page.
 
To deploy your own version of the website:
- Have git installed
- Visit the [repository](https://8000-f3c5a7a2-27fb-4a25-ae3c-88d8cc7a0a56.ws-eu01.gitpod.io/)
- Click 'Clone or download' and copy the code for http
- Open your chosen IDE (Cloud9, VS Code, etc.)
- Open a terminal in your root directory
- Type 'git clone ' followed by the code taken from github repository
    - ```git clone https://8000-f3c5a7a2-27fb-4a25-ae3c-88d8cc7a0a56.ws-eu01.gitpod.io/
- When this completes you have your own version of the website
    - Feel free to make any changes to it
- The website can be run by opening one of the HTML files within a web browser
- Visit the link provided
- Your website with any made changes will appear
- Saved changes to the website will appear here after refreshing the page

The benefits of hosting your website on GitHub pages is that any pushed changes to your project will automatically update the website. Development branches can be created and merged to the master when complete.

It may take a moment for changes to appear on the hosted website.

During development the site is written in VS Code. It is run using Live Server plugin for VS Code.
