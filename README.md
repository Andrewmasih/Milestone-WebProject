# Features

Scroll Bar:
For large chunks on information i have provided a scroll system for the user to read through the text at ease, without compromising other sections on the page.

External Links or Anchors:
The portfolio section i implimented the use of externak links to corresponding sites, here i have used icons that will takes the user to external sites that are relative to my profssional profile.

A menu sits in the nav bar, its located on the side of the screen for small screens, and on the top of the page for lrg screens. The user can access the information they require immmedaitly. 
The menu has buttons that bring up the choosen section they require to view.

# Design and Layout

The design has been developed for Mobile First approach. 

The main focus on the design and layout was to be clear and simple, as information sometimes on a cv can be clustered, and overwelming for the reader,
sometimes the readerr can be put off with the CV because of the amount of information been displayed with the space, the aim was to provide information reletive to my CV. 
From top to bottom, left to right, the information on the site is simliar to how a tradition CV is layout.

I had designed the layout in a way that doesnt overload the reader/user with too much information as sometimes a tradtional cv can.
in fact the results are that the page provides my professional info to the user with ease to read, the user is made to feel at ease/comfortable by the use of colors, layout, spacing, white space, text style and images. 

The information on the page is layout systematically, so the user is not bombared with inforamtion that the user can skip over..
The design encourges the user to take time to absorb the info comfortably, the colours are kept muted and not so bright is a contrast to the white background which reflects the type/text in a clear fashion. 

A menu is provided on the side of the screen for small screens, and on the top of the page for lrg screens so the user can access the information they require immmedaitly. 
The menu has buttons that bring up the choosen section they require to view.
